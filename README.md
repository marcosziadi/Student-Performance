# student_performance_project_1
Student performance Project (Beginner)

In this project, I intend to learn the basics of manipulating and using dataframes in python. It is my first time using this platform and these libraries.

The main goal is to try to create some graphs, find new information, or at least make it easier for everyone interested in this dataset to visualize what it is about.

I will also make use of chatgpt, bard and bing chat bots in order to optimize my code once I finished. Obviously, the goal is to do it on my own without the help of anybody, 
so I will only make use of these bots after what I was planning to code is finished, just to see what I can optimize or where I can improve.
